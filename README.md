Here is some code that I have built.


Wildlands is a top-down 2D game that I intend to flesh out more through making some sprites and animations. At present it features a movable character, a modular inventory and item system, and a basic combat system.

Above you can see the basic layout of the game. The yellow square moves through the world with WASD and is able to pick up the items and add them to an inventory.

Survive is a very basic first-person shooter. I added a store system as well as rudimentary 3D models and animations for certain actions. There is a damage system using raycasts and enemy hitboxes
