# CodeResume
Here is some code that I have built.


Wildlands is a top-down 2D game that I intend to flesh out more through making some sprites and animations. At present it features a movable character, a modular inventory and item system, and a basic combat system.


Survive is a very basic first-person shooter. I added a store system as well as rudimentary 3D models and animations for certain actions. There is a damage system using raycasts and enemy hitboxes
